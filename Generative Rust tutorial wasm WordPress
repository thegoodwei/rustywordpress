This Rust code defines a Video struct that represents a video with various properties such as title, description, url, and videoThumbnail. There are several functions that generate HTML for a single video or for a gallery of videos. The generate_video_html function generates an HTML representation of a single video by formatting a string containing the appropriate HTML tags and inserting the values of the title, description, and url fields of the Video struct into the string. The generate_thumbnail_html function is similar, but it also includes the videoThumbnail field in the generated HTML.

The generate_thumbnail_gallery_html function generates an HTML representation of a gallery of video thumbnails. It iterates over a slice of Video structs and generates a thumbnail HTML representation for each video using the generate_thumbnail_html function. It skips the video at the current_index position in the slice, so that the video at the current_index position is not included in the thumbnail gallery.

The generate_video_gallery_html function generates an HTML representation of a gallery of videos. It calls the generate_video_html function to generate the HTML for the video at the current_index position in the slice, and the generate_thumbnail_gallery_html function to generate the HTML for the thumbnail gallery. Finally, it combines the HTML for the video and thumbnail gallery into a single string and returns it.

The generate_video_gallery function is the entry point for the WebAssembly module. It is marked with the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute, which makes it possible to call this function from JavaScript. This function takes a slice of Video structs and an index into the slice, and it calls the generate_video_gallery_html function to generate the HTML for the video gallery. It returns a Result object containing either the generated HTML or an error message.

Provide detailed step by step guide to use this Rust app in wasm with WordPress web assembly plugin, including any JavaScript wrapper required. Provide details on how to install the program, where to upload the wasm and js files. Show me how to install and implement this app into my WordPress.

To use this Rust app in a WordPress site with the WebAssembly plugin, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install the WebAssembly plugin on your WordPress site. You can do this by going to the Plugins menu in the WordPress dashboard and clicking "Add New", then searching for "WebAssembly". Click the "Install Now" button to install the plugin.

Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly using a tool such as wasm-pack. Make sure to include the wasm-bindgen crate in your dependencies, as it is needed to generate the necessary JavaScript glue code for interacting with the WebAssembly module.

Upload the generated .wasm and .js files to your WordPress site. You can do this by going to the Media library in the WordPress dashboard and clicking the "Add New" button.

Create a new post or page on your WordPress site, or edit an existing one.

Click the "Add WebAssembly" button in the WordPress editor to insert a WebAssembly block into the post or page.

In the block editor, upload the .wasm and .js files that you previously uploaded to the Media library.

Add any necessary JavaScript wrapper code to interact with the WebAssembly module. You can do this by clicking the "Edit as HTML" button in the block editor and adding the JavaScript code directly in the block.

Publish or update the post or page to make the WebAssembly app available on your site.

That's it! You should now be able to use the Rust app on your WordPress site through the WebAssembly plugin.

Note: You may need to adjust the Rust code or the JavaScript wrapper code to fit your specific needs and use case. For example, you may need to modify the function signatures or add additional functions to interact with the WebAssembly module.

How do I need to modify function signatures to interact with the web assembly module

To interact with the WebAssembly module from JavaScript, you'll need to modify the function signatures in the Rust code to include the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute. This attribute tells the wasm-bindgen tool to generate the necessary JavaScript glue code for calling the function from JavaScript.

For example, if you have a Rust function like this:

Copy code
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
To call this function from JavaScript, you'll need to add the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute like this:

Copy code
#[wasm_bindgen]
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
Then, you can call the add function from JavaScript like this:

Copy code
const result = wasmModule.add(1, 2);
You'll need to add the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute to any Rust functions that you want to call from JavaScript. If you want to return more complex data types such as structs or strings, you'll need to use the JsValue type and the JsValue::from_serde function provided by the wasm-bindgen crate to serialize and deserialize the data.

For example, to return a Video struct from a Rust function to JavaScript, you can define the function like this:

Copy code
#[wasm_bindgen]
fn get_video() -> JsValue {
    let video = Video {
        title: "My video".to_string(),
        description: "A video about Rust and WebAssembly".to_string(),
        url: "https://example.com/video.mp4".to_string(),
        videoThumbnail: "https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg".to_string(),
    };
    JsValue::from_serde(&video).unwrap()
}
And you can call this function from JavaScript like this:

Copy code
const video = wasmModule.get_video();
console.log(video.title);
console.log(video.description);
console.log(video.url);
console.log(video.videoThumbnail);
That's it! You should now be able to call Rust functions from JavaScript and pass data back and forth between the two languages.

Can you reprint my rust code to include the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute. Provide extensive commenting in the code comments. Print a cargo toml file. Then, print a JavaScript wrapper with extensive comments that teach how to code a wrapper. 

Certainly! Here is the Rust code with the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute added to each function that you want to be able to call from JavaScript
