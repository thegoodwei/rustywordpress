Program with me. Make a template for a Rust app using Yew, wasm_bindgen and web3. Create a JavaScript wrapper.

Certainly! Here is a template for a Rust app using Yew, wasm_bindgen, and web3:

Copy code
use yew::{html, Callback, ClickEvent, Component, ComponentLink, Html, ShouldRender};
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use web3::{
    contract::{Contract, Options},
    transports::Http,
    types::{Address, U256},
    Web3,
};

struct App {
    web3: Web3<Http>,
    contract: Option<Contract<Http>>,
    accounts: Vec<Address>,
    value: U256,
    callback: Callback<ClickEvent>,
}

enum Msg {
    Click,
    Load,
}

impl Component for App {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        let callback = link.callback(|_| Msg::Click);

        App {
            web3: Web3::new(Http::new("http://localhost:8545").expect("invalid host")),
            contract: None,
            accounts: Vec::new(),
            value: U256::zero(),
            callback,
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Click => {
                let contract = self.contract.as_ref().expect("contract not loaded");
                let accounts = self.accounts.as_ref();
                let value = self.value;
                let result = contract.functions().set(value).call(accounts[0]).wait();
                match result {
                    Ok(()) => println!("Success!"),
                    Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
                }
            }
            Msg::Load => {
                let web3 = self.web3.clone();
                let contract_address: Address = "0x123...".parse().expect("invalid contract address");
                let contract = Contract::from_json(
                    web3,
                    contract_address,
                    include_bytes!("contract.json"),
                )
                .expect("failed to load contract");
                self.contract = Some(contract);
                let accounts = web3.eth().accounts().wait().expect("failed to get accounts");
                self.accounts = accounts;
            }
        }
        true
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <button onclick=&self.callback>{ "Click me!" }</button>
        }
    }
}

#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn run_app() {
    App::<()>::new(()).mount_to_body();
}
To create a JavaScript wrapper for this Rust app, you can use the wasm_bindgen crate to generate a JavaScript module that exports the run_app function. You can then use this module in your JavaScript code to run the Rust app.

Here's an example of how you can generate the JavaScript module:

Copy code
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_

Continue 

Certainly! Here's how you can generate the JavaScript module and use it in your JavaScript code:

Copy code
// Generate the JavaScript module
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) {
    alert(&format!("Hello, {}!", name));
}

// In your JavaScript code
import * as wasm from './wasm_module';

wasm.greet('World');
To use the run_app function from the Rust template in your JavaScript code, you can simply import it in the same way and call it:

Copy code
import * as wasm from './wasm_module';

wasm.run_app();
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information.




Wade B
Give me more about how to create the JavaScript module for wasm. Give more comments in the code // code comment everything. 

Certainly! Here is an example of how you can create a JavaScript module for your Rust WebAssembly (Wasm) code, with more comments explaining each step:

Copy code
// Import the necessary crates for generating the JavaScript module
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// Declare an extern function for the alert function in JavaScript
// This allows us to call the alert function from our Rust code
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

// Declare the function that we want to expose to JavaScript
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) {
    // Call the alert function in JavaScript
    alert(&format!("Hello, {}!", name));
}
To generate the JavaScript module, you can use the wasm-pack tool. First, make sure that you have wasm-pack installed. You can install it by running the following command:

Copy code
cargo install wasm-pack
Then, navigate to the root directory of your Rust project and run the following command to generate the JavaScript module:

Copy code
wasm-pack build
This will generate a pkg directory containing the JavaScript module and other necessary files.

To use the JavaScript module in your JavaScript code, you can simply import it using the import statement:

Copy code
import * as wasm from './pkg/wasm_module';

// Call the greet function from the Rust code
wasm.greet('World');
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information.

Is this template compatible with WordPress webAssembly plugin 

It is possible to use WebAssembly (Wasm) in WordPress, including by using the WordPress WebAssembly plugin. However, the template that I provided is a standalone Rust app that is intended to be run in a browser environment, rather than being integrated into a WordPress plugin.

To use the template with the WordPress WebAssembly plugin, you will need to modify the template to fit the plugin's requirements. This may involve adapting the template to be more modular, so that it can be included in a WordPress plugin and called from WordPress PHP code.

You can find more information about the WordPress WebAssembly plugin, including documentation and examples, on the plugin's GitHub page: https://github.com/phpwasm/wp-webassembly

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information.

Certainly! Here is the rest of the modified template for a Rust app using Yew, wasm_bindgen, and web3 that fits the requirements of the WordPress WebAssembly (Wasm) plugin:

Copy code

pub fn run_app(callback: Box<dyn Fn(Message)>) {
    App::new(callback).mount_to_body();
}
To use this modified template with the WordPress WebAssembly plugin, you will need to compile it to WebAssembly (Wasm) and include it in your WordPress plugin.

First, make sure that you have wasm-pack installed. You can install it by running the following command:

Copy code
cargo install wasm-pack
Then, navigate to the root directory of your Rust project and run the following command to generate the WebAssembly (Wasm) file:

Copy code
wasm-pack build
This will generate a pkg directory containing the Wasm file and other necessary files.

Next, create a new WordPress plugin and include the Wasm file in it. You can do this by placing the Wasm file in the plugin's directory and using the wp_enqueue_script function to include it in the plugin.

Here is an example of how you could include the Wasm file in your WordPress plugin:

Copy code
function enqueue_wasm_scripts() {
    // Include the Wasm file in the plugin
    wp_enqueue_script(
        'wasm-module',
        plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . '/pkg/wasm_module.wasm',

Then, you can use the wp_add_inline_script function to call the run_app function from your WordPress plugin. You will need to pass a JavaScript callback function to the run_app function, which will be called whenever a message is received from the Rust code.

Here is an example of how you could call the run_app function from your WordPress plugin:

Will this work with the WordPress webAssembly plugin? Show me that first. 

It is possible to use the modified template for a Rust app using Yew, wasm_bindgen, and web3 with the WordPress WebAssembly (Wasm) plugin, but you will need to follow the steps that I provided to integrate the template into a WordPress plugin and include it in your WordPress site.

To use the modified template with the WordPress WebAssembly plugin, you will need to compile it to WebAssembly (Wasm) and include it in your WordPress plugin. You can do this by using the wasm-pack tool to generate the Wasm file and the wp_enqueue_script function to include it in your WordPress plugin.

Then, you can use the wp_add_inline_script function to call the run_app function from your WordPress plugin. You will need to pass a JavaScript callback function to the run_app function, which will be called whenever a message is received from the Rust code.

What did you mean when you said "Then, you can use the wp_add_inline_script function to call the run_app function from your WordPress plugin. You will need to pass a JavaScript callback function to the run_app function, which will be called whenever a message is received from the Rust code."

When I said "Then, you can use the wp_add_inline_script function to call the run_app function from your WordPress plugin," I meant that you can use the wp_add_inline_script function in your WordPress plugin to call the run_app function that is defined in the WebAssembly (Wasm) module that you included in your plugin. This will allow you to start running the Rust code in your plugin.

The wp_add_inline_script function takes three arguments: the handle of the script to which the inline script should be added, the inline script to be added, and the position of the script in the page (either 'before' or 'after'). In this case, you would pass the handle of the Wasm module as the first argument, a string containing a call to the run_app function as the second argument, and 'before' as the third argument.

You will need to pass a JavaScript callback function to the run_app function as an argument. This callback function will be called whenever a message is received from the Rust code. The Rust code uses the callback function to communicate with the JavaScript code, allowing you to interact with the Rust code from your WordPress plugin.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information.
